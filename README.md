# Togglex

Simple Elixir wrapper for the [Toggl API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs).

Heavily based on [ExTracker](https://github.com/dashofcode/extracker) and
[Tentacat](https://github.com/edgurgel/tentacat).

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

1. Add togglex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:togglex, "~> 0.1.0"}]
  end
  ```

2. Ensure togglex is started before your application:

  ```elixir
  def application do
    [applications: [:togglex]]
  end
  ```

## Usage

All calls to Toggl APIs must use a Client which contains the access token and
the endpoint. The API is splitted in two different parts. The first one is
called **Toggl API** which is essentially a RESTful API that you can use to
create, update, delete and get most of the resources from Toggl service. On the
other hand there is a read-only **Reports API** which you can use to obtain
aggregated data based on more or less complex queries.

### Toggl API examples

Initializing the client for the Toggl API endpoint:

```elixir
client = Togglex.Client.new(%{access_token: "YOU_ACCESS_TOKEN"}, :api)
```

Get workspace projects:

```elixir
Togglex.Api.Workspaces.projects(client, "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID")
```

### Reports API examples

Initializing the client for the Reports API endpoint:

```elixir
client = Togglex.Client.new(%{access_token: "YOU_ACCESS_TOKEN"}, :reports)
```

Getting a detailed report based on some parameters:

```elixir
Togglex.Reports.detailed(client, %{workspace_id: "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID", project_ids: "COMMA_SEPARATED_PROJECT_IDS"})
```

Getting a summarized report based on some parameters:

```elixir
Togglex.Reports.summary(client, %{workspace_id: "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID", project_ids: "COMMA_SEPARATED_PROJECT_IDS"})
```

#### PDF Reports

Toggl allows you to retrieve reports in PDF format. To do that you only need to
call a report function passing `:pdf` atom as last parameter. The value returned
is a binary you can use to write a file:

```elixir
pdf = Togglex.Reports.summary(client, %{workspace_id: "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID", project_ids: "COMMA_SEPARATED_PROJECT_IDS"}, :pdf)
File.write!(path, pdf)
```

Check out in the next section which API calls are already implemented in this
wrapper.
